# Gamba

This is a program to simulate betting on the Roulette from the video game [Rust](https://rust.facepunch.com/).

It was created as a way to quickly simulate gambling strategies to see the outcomes.

Takeaway: House always wins, don't gamble.

Shortfalls: 

1. The numbers are generated using the Random class, and may not accurately mirror the implementation done by the game developers.
2. Does not support additional funds, just a starting amount.
3. Only allows for one bet per spin.
